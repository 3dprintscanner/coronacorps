We are a group of volunteers living in the local area who want to help our community in this challenging time. We are happy to help however we can - whether it be picking up some groceries, walking your pet or just having a chat if you need one.

**We will never ask you to pay us for your time**, and will only ever accept money from you if it is a direct payment for something we buy on your behalf (for example, if we run to the supermarket for you).

In return, we ask that you respect the health, well-being and generosity of our volunteers and take particular care not to risk passing the virus on to others if you may be unwell. 

**Please donâ€™t give us your personal information unless you are happy for us to pass that information on to one of our volunteers.**

Please note that we are:
- **Completely volunteer** based and are not associated with any government department or other company or group 
- **Not able to help you with medical advice** - please refer to the latest NHS guidance and contact emergency services if you need medical help quickly
- **Not able to accept any liability** in relation to the help you ask for or that we offer to you
- **Ready and willing to support our community** in any way we can during this time
