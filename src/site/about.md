This group is for people who want to request and offer support during the COVID-19/Corona Virus outbreak. We recognise this is a challenging and uncertain time for our community and want to find ways in which we can support each other. We will be coordinating volunteers across Highbury to support our community with tasks we might find ourselves unable to do, due to self-isolation - whether it‚Äôs picking up shopping, walking a pet or just having a chat if you need one, we will be working together to offer this support to each other. 

This is a voluntary service to our community - we will never expect anyone to pay for our support and will only ever accept money to cover the cost of things, such as shopping. We are looking at ways to limit this and will inform you of any updates on this. 

For all concerned, requesting and offering support, we ask that you respect the health, wellbeing and generosity we are showing to each other and take particular care not to risk passing the virus or any other contagious illnesses to others if you may be unwell. If you are unwell or become unwell, please do inform us to help us put in appropriate measures and to take care of each other safely. We recognise that someone offering support might well be or become someone requesting, which is why we are encouraging people to fill out both forms, [offer support](/volunteer) and [get support](/support), and please do send a new one if your circumstances change.  

Please only share your information with us if you are happy for us to pass this onto other people volunteering and requesting support. What will share will be limited and only used to fulfill the support request adequately. 

**Please note that we are**: 

 - Completely community volunteer-based and are not associated with any government department, agency or other company or group
 - Not able to help you with medical advice - we will share some practical information in the resources section about health and safety. For any other medical concerns or emergencies, we recommend contact the NHS or GP directly. Please contact the emergency services if you need help quickly
 - Not able to accept an liability in relation to the help you offer or request
 - Ready to support our community in any way we can to support the smooth running of this community initiative

Thank you for being part of such a great community. We are overwhelmed and really proud of how Highbury and other surrounding communities are pulling together and supporting each other during this difficult time - you are all amazing people!
